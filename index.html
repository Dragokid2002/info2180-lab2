        <h2>"Welcome to Summoner's Rift"</h2>
        <p class="post-meta">October 4, 2024 by Romaine (Neo)</p>

        <p>What is Summoner’s Rift, you might ask? Let me introduce you to this iconic battlefield from League of Legends, a game where strategy, skill, and teamwork come together for a well-earned victory. 
           The Rift hosts intense 5v5 battles, where champions from across Runeterra gather in a relentless quest to destroy the enemy Nexus.
           The map is divided into three lanes—Top, Mid, and Bot—with a treacherous Jungle threading through them all. No matter your playstyle, there's a champion for you—whether you're tanking the frontlines, assassinating enemies with finesse, enchanting your team with support, or sniping foes from a distance. 
           Coordination and communication with your team are the keys for succession.
           For beginners, the layout might seem overwhelming at first, but with a little practice (and a lot of fun), you’ll soon find yourself climbing the ranks.</p>
        <p>While League of Legends has brought joy and community into my life during tough times, what matters most is your journey. So, Summoners, ready your skills, craft your battle strategy, and queue up for action. Welcome to Summoner’s Rift… “Thirty seconds until minion spawn!”</p>

        <h2>The Ride of Doom!!!</h2>
        <p class="post-meta">October 4, 2024 by Romaine (Neo)</p>
        <img src="Joker.jpeg" alt= "Blog Image 2" class="post-image-left">
        <p>Monday, August 5, 2024—etched into my memory like it was just yesterday. I arrived at Six Flags DC, adrenaline surging, ready to conquer a fresh set of rollercoasters. The day was supposed to be filled with excitement, but instead, it almost ended on "The Ride of Doom": the Joker
           The day began with a whimsical teacup ride that spun me so fast I was certain I’d lose my breakfast. Next, I took on a ride that launched me 72 feet into the air, only to plummet back down at a speed that made my soul lag. 
           The Joker was supposed to be next, but it was temporarily shut down for maintenance, so I opted for the Harlequin instead—a pendulum ride that, instead of slowing down, kept speeding up.
           That’s when I discovered crying could be involuntary.</p>
        <p>Finally, with the Joker back in action, I was ready. Strapped in, there was no turning back. “See you if you make it back byeeeee,” the ride announcer teased. 
        And just like that, the nightmare began. The next 30 seconds were the worst of my life. The ride was not just fast, it was a blur of brutal twists and sharp turns that forced my head forward while the deafening sound of metal screamed around me. 
        The ride ended before I could even process what happened, leaving me with regret, neck pain, and a mild case of whiplash.I was ready to call it quits right then and there but my friends dragged me across the park, and while I may have braved a few more, one thing is for sure: I’m never getting on the Joker again.</p>
